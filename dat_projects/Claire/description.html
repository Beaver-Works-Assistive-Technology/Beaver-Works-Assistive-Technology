											<h1>Standing Trackpad</h1>

											<h2>Co-Designer</h2>
										</header>
										<p>My co-designer is my dad (Dennis). He is 49 years old and works as a project manager, spending the workday on the computer. In his free time, he enjoys reading, cooking, watching movies, and running. </p>

										<p>Over time, he developed carpal tunnel syndrome from extensive computer mouse use with his right hand. This causes wrist pain and a numb feeling in his hand. To take the pressure off of his wrist, he switched to a vertical mouse. However, he still felt strain from using a scroll wheel and pushing down on the mouse to click. Trackpads and trackballs also didn’t improve his condition because they required him to keep his wrist in a tense position. Currently, he is looking for a solution that allows him to keep his arm and wrist as relaxed as possible without interrupting his workday. </p>

											<h2>Co-Designer Needs Statement</h2>
										</header>
										<ul>
											<li>The product must keep his hand in a loose position rather than gripping an object.</li>
											<li>The product must allow him to use mouse functions (scrolling + clicking) without straining wrist.</li>
											<li>The product must prevent his wrist from being pressed on a surface.</li>
											<li>The product must be comfortable to use while standing up.</li>
										</ul>
										
										<header>
											<h2>Product Requirements</h2>
										</header>
										<ul>
											<li>Can scroll/click while keeping hand close to relaxed position</li>
											<li>Tap to click trackpad</li>
											<li>Adjustable position</li>
											<li>Allows hand to be in natural position when standing</li>
											<li>Stable</li>
											<li>26.5 inches high for standing position (from floor to bottom of trackpad)</li>
											<li>Lightweight</li>
										</ul>

											<h2>Initial Brainstorming Narrative</h2>
										</header>

										<p>My co-designer spends the majority of his day using a computer and mouse at work and felt frustrated with the frequent pain he felt in his wrist. This pain often interfered with his workday, so I wanted to make an assistive device that would allow my co-designer to work with his hands, wrist, and arm in a less strained position throughout the day.</p>
										<p>Initially, I thought of adding different grip options on his mouse to prevent his hand from remaining in the same grip position. However, gripping a mouse and using a scroll wheel both eventually put stress on his wrist. During the interview process, I also learned that he prefers to stand up when working; his most comfortable standing position was having his arms straight and hands relaxed at his sides. Based on this information, I decided to put a trackpad in a vertical position at the height his hand reached when relaxing his arms at his side. The trackpad would be placed in a 3d printed case, then secured by fabric straps that clip onto my co-designer’s pants. Therefore, he would potentially be able to keep his hands and arms as close to his relaxed position as possible.</p>
