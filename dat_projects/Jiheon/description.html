											<h2>Co-Designer</h2>
										</header>
										<p>My co designer is my brother who goes by Seung. He is 16 years old and currently lives in Evanston, Illinois. He goes to Evanston Township High School and is a rising sophomore. He enjoys playing basketball and coding. Whenever he goes to school for summer classes or visits the lab for his internship, he wears a walking boot or a leg fracture bandage, which makes it difficult for him to rest his legs at school and in his lab. He noted that while resting his legs on a chair, people will often contact with his injured leg and cause pain as they pass by his chair.</p>

											<h2>Co-Designer Needs Statement</h2>
										</header>
										<ul>
											




											<li>Product should help him rest on legs</li>
											<li>Product should be portable and lightweight</li>
											<li>Product should be solid</li>
											<li>Product should prevent his fractured leg from being damaged by others or having contact with others (people who pass by)</li>
										</ul>

											<h2>Product Requirements</h2>
										</header>
										
										<ul>
											<li>Light Weight and solid</li>
											<li>Portable</li>
											<li>Comfortable; it should protect his leg from others passing by </li>
											<li>Product should not be too big</li>
											<li>It should fully cover his fractured leg</li>
											<li>Easy to carry with hands</li>
										</ul>

											<h2>Initial Brainstorming Narrative</h2>
										</header>

										<p>I didn't want my brother to worry about his injured leg at school because of the frequent people who would accidentally contact my brother's leg while passing him. He tried to find the solution to prevent these accidents, but he found that he could only put his leg on an extra chair and cover his leg with a jacket. Thus, I decided to make a product that protects his injured leg from various factors such as classmates passing by him or the rigid surface of a chair. When I did additional research, I couldn't find any products that were similar to mine, but only a leg holder pad that can be applied to my product as a cushion. My product would consist of two chairs that have plastic or aluminum legs and parts that can be easily folded, making it portable as well. The concept that I decided to move forward with has a portable chair that has an attached leg holder.</p>
