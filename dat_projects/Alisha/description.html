											<h1>Blackout!</h1>

											<h2>Co-Designer</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Divya is a rising senior in high school who lives at home with her parents and her little sister. She uses she/him pronouns (which can be used interchangeably!) and plays varsity field hockey at school. Divya enjoys all sorts of mediums of art, such as clay, paint, and wood. Recently, she's been taking a dive into graffiti and street art and her signature or graffiti 'tag' is a bloody eye! He has been my friend since kindergarten and loves to binge watch Criminal Minds and go for walks with his husky, Moo. Divya gets sudden migraines that give her blurry vision and makes her extremely sensitive to light. Previous solutions such as eye masks didn't work for him as it pressed against his eyes and made the migraine auras worse. Her room also only has blinds, which don't block out light well enough for it not to affect her migraines.</p>

											<li>Divya needs something that blocks out all light during her migraines so the light doesn’t make it worse</li>
											<li>Divya needs something that won’t press against his eyes and is comfortable enough to sleep in</li>
											<li>Divya needs something that can alert her parents when the migraine starts</li>
											<li>Divya needs something that reminds him to stay hydrated because the lack of water can also bring on migraines</li>

											<h2>Initial Brainstorming Narrative</h2>
										</header>

										<p>When Divya told me about his migraines, I immediately started thinking of some sort of blackout glasses to get rid of the light that made his migraines worse. I realized, however, that traditional glasses wouldn't work because Divya would be sleeping in them, and the frames might make her uncomfortable, so I knew I would have to add a more comfortable way for the glasses to wrap around the face.</p>
										<p>I initially looked into specific blackout lenses for Divya. I found that the lenses were viable, but the problem with them would be the light that comes in from the top and bottom, as they weren't close to the face. I talked with Divya and I was given the idea to look into products like ski goggles instead of plain glasses. The pros of ski goggles included the fact that they pressed against the face with foam around it so it wouldn't touch the eyes but still provide coverage. The parts I had to focus on were the vents in the ski goggles where light could potentially come in, and I also had to think about how I would improve on the straps to make it more adjustable and comfortable for sleep. </p>
