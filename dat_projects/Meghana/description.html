											<h1>Foot-lift</h1>

											<h2>Co-Designer</h2>
										</header>
										<ul>
											<li>Rishitha is a rising high school senior</li>
											<li>During the school year, she usually spends a majority of her time at school or studying at home</li>
											<li>She often walks her dog around her community</li>
											<li>In her free time, she enjoys cooking and baking</li>
											<li>Rishitha experiences flat feet and had multiple feet injuries, so she struggles to walk or exercise for a long period of time</li>
											<li>She has previously tried custom insoles, compression socks, physical therapy, and ankle braces, but they only helped for a short period of time</li>
										</ul>
										
										<header>
											<h2>Co-Designer Needs Statement</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Rishitha needs to:</p>

										<ul>
											<li>Walk in different environments (inside of the house, at school, outside)</li>
											<li>Exercise (run, bike, walk) without feeling significant pain in her right foot</li>
											<li>Go up and down stairs</li>
											<li>Have a supported foot arch and ankle for her right foot</li>
											<li>Move her ankle comfortably</li>
											<li>Reuse the product multiple times</li>
											<li>Wear multiple shoes</li>
										</ul>
										
										<header>
											<h2>Product Requirements</h2>
										</header>

										<p>The product should:</p>

										<ul>
											<li>Be durable and washable</li>
											<li>Provide adequate support for her right foot’s ankle and arch</li>
											<li>Be comfortable</li>
											<li>Fit onto Rishitha’s right foot</li>
											<li>Allow for ankle and feet movement</li>
											<li>Be compatible with multiple shoes (slippers, tennis shoes, sandals)</li>
										</ul>

										<header>
											<h2>Initial Brainstorming Narrative</h2>
										</header>

										<p>To clarify the problem, I broke down my co-designer’s foot support problems into two categories: ankle support and foot arch support. Through the interview, I learned that the foot arch and ankle needed the most support, so I mainly focused on these two categories when conducting my internal and external searches.</p>
										<p>For the brainstorming process, I mainly focused on improving the support and comfort of existing solutions that my co-designer used. Some ideas I considered included heating/cooling technology, an insole that could attach to multiple shoes, customized insoles (orthotics), and more comfortable ankle braces. I selected a pair of socks that would support the ankle with an elastic band and foot arch using an insole. I chose to move forward with this concept because the product would be easy to take on and off, compatible with multiple different shoes, and comfortable for my co-designer to use.</p>

											<h3>Overall Design Objective:</h3>
										</header>
										<ul>
											<li>The overall objective is to build a comfortable and durable product that will support the co-designer’s right foot and be compatible with multiple shoes. </li>
											<li>Because support and comfort are difficult to determine objectively, these parts of the objective will be met when my co-designer feels that the product is comfortable and supportive. Durability will be determined by whether the product does not tear apart or rip during the testing process. To determine whether the product is compatible with multiple shoes, the testing process will include testing with various shoes: tennis shoes, flip flops, and sandals.</li>
										</ul>

										<header>
											<h3>Prototype Design Objectives:</h3>
										</header>
										<ul>
											<li>For the low-fidelity prototype, the main objective is to create a prototype that will support the co-designer’s right foot while also being comfortable when the co-designer walks. </li>
											<li>This prototype should fit the co-designer’s feet, but it does not need to be made out of durable materials, the prototype does not need to fit inside of her shoe, and the appearance of the prototype is not a priority for this iteration.</li>
											<li>After these objectives are met or I have a clear idea on how I can improve the prototype to meet these objectives, I will continue with the next iteration.</li>
										</ul>

										<header>
											<h3>Assumptions:</h3>
										</header>
										<ul>
											<li>Because my co-designer wants to use the product for a long period of time, the product will likely need to be washed. </li>
											<li>My co-designer lives in Virginia, so the product needs to withstand a temperature range of 20-90 degrees F.</li>
										</ul>


										<header>
											<h3>Bill of Materials:</h3>
										</header>
										<ul>
											<li>3 socks that cover the ankle</li>
											<li>Flat piece of Cardboard</li>
											<li>Modeling Clay</li>
											<li>Needle</li>
											<li>Thread</li>
											<li>Muslin fabric</li>
											<li>T-shirt fabric</li>
										</ul>
										<p><span class="image fit"><img src="iteration_2_drawing_Meghana.png" alt="a drawing of and ankle and arch support device" /></span></p>

										<header>
											<h3>Test Plan</h3>
										</header>
										<p>I plan to test three variables: the insole and muslin sock, the insole and t-shirt fabric sock, and a control (no prototype). To test, I will ask my co-designer to walk 10 feet on the ground while wearing the prototype. After the test, I will ask her to describe the fit and support of the prototype.</p>
										<p>The data collected will be subjective qualitative data to determine whether the prototype fits and supports my co-designer’s foot. Because the prototype is tailored to fit Rishitha’s foot, the prototype can only be tested with her.</p>
										<p><span class="image fit"><img src="insole sock on codesigner - Meghana.jpg" alt="a person wearing an ankle and foot support device" /></span></p>
										
										<header>
											<h3>Test Results</h3>
										</header>

										<ul>
											<li>The insole sock provided support for the arch, but her feet still rolled inwards because there was not enough support on the sides of the insole, and the clay flattened to the pressure of my co-designer’s right foot.</li>
											<li>The muslin ankle sock did not fit my co-designer’s foot because the muslin was not adjustable and did not stretch when my co-designer tried to wear the sock.</li>
											<li>The t-shirt ankle sock fit my co-designer’s foot, but the fabric did not have the tension expected to provide adequate support to the ankle.</li>
											<li>When my co-designer tested the t-shirt ankle sock and the insole sock together, the multiple layers of socks made the product uncomfortably thick, and there was little support for the ankle.</li>
										</ul>
										
										<header>
											<h3>Prototype Conclusions</h3>
										</header>

										<ul>
											<li>The ankle socks did not fit the co-designer, so the ankle sock needs to be redesigned.</li>
											<li>The insole provided some, but not enough, support, but it fit my co-designer so I can move onto the next iteration for the insole component using more durable materials.</li>
											<li>The combination of socks were extremely thick, so I need to redesign the sock system by either removing the layers of socks or by using thinner socks.</li>
											<li>I learned that even though I carefully measured my co-designer’s right foot, the lack of adjustability made it difficult to have the right amount of tension and stretch in the prototype. So, I will move onto the next iteration, but I will incorporate adjustable components, such as velcro straps, into the prototype’s design to provide a better fit and to provide more support.</li>
											<li>I found that the lack of elasticity in the t-shirt and muslin fabric from the ankle sock made the socks difficult to sew and wear, so I will purchase a more elastic material for the next iteration.</li>
											<li>Sewing the muslin and t-shirt fabric onto the socks was more difficult than I expected, so the stitches ended up being messy and loose. For the next iteration, I will try to research better methods of sewing material onto socks, and I will spend more time sewing so that the stitches are more uniform.</li>
										</ul>
