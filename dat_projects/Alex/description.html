											<h2>Co-Designer</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Sawyer is a rising senior in high school with type 1 diabetes. He lives at home with his parents. When he wakes up and before he goes to bed he has to calibrate his insulin pump, and before lunch everyday he takes a sample of his blood by poking his finger with a needle to check his blood sugar and adjust his intake and activities. I'm in the same grade as him and friends with him. He's been teaching martial arts for years, mainly taekwondo but he sometimes mixes in muay thai and kickboxing, and he has a black belt in taekwondo. He's played the piano since childhood and picked up the guitar during quarantine. He also answers hotline calls for an organization called Teenline, where he picks up calls from random teens and helps them talk through issues such as anxiety, depression, and even relationship problems. Something that he mentioned during our interview was that whenever he goes swimming he has to take off his insulin pump and place it on the side, which can get annoying because it beeps if he gets too far away from it. He doesn't want to use a commercial water proof case because they're too bulky.</p>

											<h2>Co-Designer Needs Statement</h2>

										<ul>
											<li>I need a waterproof case for my insulin pump that isnâ€™t bulky.</li>
											<li>I need to be able to easily fit the wire into the waterproof case.</li>
											<li>I need to have a waterproof case specifically fitted for the model of my insulin pump.</li>
										</ul>
