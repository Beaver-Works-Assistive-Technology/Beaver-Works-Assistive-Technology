											<h2>Co-Designer</h2>
										</header>
										<p>My co-designer is Alfonso. He has a wife and three kids, has a great sense of humor, and loves to spend time with his family. Alfonso is a person who is quadriplegic.</p>
										
										<header>
											<h2>Co-Designer Needs Statement</h2>
										</header>
										<p>My co-designer needs a device that will allow him to go on off-road trips with his family, and can be controlled with his hands, and without the use of his limbs.</p>
										
										<header>
											<h2>Product Requirements</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Product will be able to support a 200 pound 6'2" user. Is operated only by a joystick. Can go up to 13 mph. Can go on grass, woods trails, and fit on side walks. </p>

											<h2>Initial Brainstorming Narrative</h2>
										</header>

										<p>I decided early on that I was going to get a frame from an existing product as a jumping off point. I did a lot of external research on small off-road vehicles with electric motor capabilities. I settled on using some form of a commercial trike, and looked through various companies to find a frame that worked best for my design. I went through many iterations of brainstorming on how steering would work. I found that the steering damper worked in a linear motion, and I figured instead of the steering moving the damper, a linear actuator in its place could conversely control the steering. For braking I toyed around with a lever design, but decided a compact solenoid brake would work best, although it would have a binary input of either braking or not.</p>
