											<h2>Co-Designer</h2>
										</header>
										<p>My co-designer is my dad, whose pseudonym will be Victor. He is a 42-year old man who lives in the Bay Area in California with his family. He works as a product manager at a software company in the area, and works on a laptop at home for most of his weekdays. His hobbies include running and playing tennis, which he does on the weekends. Over the weekends, he also tends gardens and mows his lawn for about two hours on a weekend morning.</p>

										<p>Victor suffers from allergies. His main trigger is grass pollen, which means that gardening often triggers his allergies. His symptoms include itching of the eyes and rashes on his forearms and forehead. These symptoms are usually exacerbated by sun exposure. To mitigate these, he wears hats and long-sleeved shirts outside to protect his skin from the sun, which has been effective. He has also worn masks and sunglasses outside to protect from pollen. While these have worked, they have been uncomfortable for him to wear, so he wishes to have a way to protect himself from getting pollen in his eyes, nose, and mouth while still being able to garden.</p>

											<h2>Initial Brainstorming Narrative</h2>
										</header>

										<p>Before I started looking at solutions, I made sure to clarify the meaning of each of my co-designer’s need statements with them during our interview. During this process, I learned about many nuances of his prior attempts to solve his issues with allergies that I kept in mind while brainstorming. I learned that sunglasses, which he had tried in the past to reduce the amount of pollen that went into his eyes, restricted his peripheral vision to a degree that he found uncomfortable. I also learned that he had tried wearing several different types of masks while gardening for the same reason, ranging from reusable cotton masks to bandanas. All of them hindered his breathing to a certain extent, but looser masks also tended to fly inside his mouth and fully restrict his breathing as he was moving. As I proceeded to the external search, I made sure to look for these weaknesses in products on the market and think about how I could rectify them. </p>
										<p>Later on in the process, using all of this information, I fully clarified the objective of my product in one sentence: The product must protect the co-designer’s eyes, nose, and mouth from pollen and other plant-related allergens while he gardens without restricting his movement, breathing, and visibility, and while being reusable and easy to clean. </p>
										<p>Next, I started my external search researching different types of masks. I knew that, for this product to lessen my dad’s symptoms, it was essential for it to block the right sized particles (I decided that this should be around 15 microns, since it is what some quick research told me was the smallest average diameter of a grain of pollen). I found several options, but the one that looked most promising was the Respro Allergy Mask as it looked comfortable and was reusable. </p>
										<p>After this, I started looking for options to protect my dad’s eyes. I discovered glasses made for hay fever and dry eye, which had plastic or silicone pieces above and around the sides of the lenses to create a closer seal with the face and block particles from getting in and out. These designs helped inform my designs for my own goggles as I moved into the internal search. </p>
										<p>The drawings shown are the designs I came up with during my internal search. Several of them are variations upon the idea of having a store-bought mask and goggles that I design, though  some of them explore joining the two in one product. After I drew these quick sketches to record my ideas, I evaluated them against each other using the table. The numbers in each cell are on a scale from one to five, five meaning that the product performs extremely well in that criterion.</p>

										<p><span class="image fit"><img src="Design Matrix - Nandana.png" alt="design matrix" /></span></p>
										<p>After using this design matrix, I identified the two designs that scored the highest (choosing the second-place design based on what I thought would be safer to build) and drew more detailed sketches of those. After meeting with my co-designer once more and getting his feedback, I chose the second one (design 9 in the matrix), which is shown, to prototype. </p>
