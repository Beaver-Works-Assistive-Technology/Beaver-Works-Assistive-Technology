									<p>This four-week summer program is a full-time product design and engineering course where high school students work with a member of their community to co-design and build a piece of assistive technology. The course includes synchronous online lectures, hands-on design exercises, small group technical mentorship, and project management activities culminating with students documenting and developing a custom AT solution.</p>

									<p>This course was offered in person in 2019 and is being offered virtually in 2021.</p>

										<h2>What is Assistive Technology?</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										In short, assistive technology (AT) is a device or a program that helps someone function in their daily life. More specifically, people with disabilities use assistive technology to overcome social, technological, or physical barriers in a range of settings. For example, someone might use:
										<ul>
											<li>a motorized wheelchair to get around in public</li>
											<li>screen reader software to hear on-screen content read out loud at the office</li>
											<li>an automatic page turner while studying at school</li>	
										</ul>

										Assistive technology usually refers to technology in the context of disability, but can refer more broadly to things that help with impairments beyond what are traditionally considered "disability."

										<h2>What is "co-design" and why do you use it?</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										We we design solutions for people, end users can have widely varying levels of input during the design process. In this course, we emphasize the use of <i>co-design</i>, in which the end user of the product plays an <i>active role</i> in the process, from requirements development, to testing, feedback, and refinement. The term <i>co-designer</i> not only emphasizes their active participation, but also acknowledges their own domain expertise on how they carry out their own lives, which is especially important in the context of disability, because different disabilities manifest in different ways, and people have very individual adaptations that they may be used to.

										Co-design isn't always practical or possible though, especially when building general products for use by lots of people, or because of the time involved by the user, but the skills learned in the co-design process are very transferable to general product design and engineering.
