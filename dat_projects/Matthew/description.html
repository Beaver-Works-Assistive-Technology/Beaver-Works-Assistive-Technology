											<h2>Co-Designer</h2>
										</header>
										<p>My co-designer is my grandpa, whose pseudonym will be L. He is 86 years old and currently lives in Seoul, Korea.  He enjoys watching TV, hanging out with friends, and playing card games. One of his favorite games to play is poker. L started to notice hand tremors about 15 years ago. He would spill his drinks whenever the hand tremors occurred. L noted that when he tries to not spill his drinks, he tends to spill more than when he does not pay attention to his hand tremors. </p>

										<header>
											<h2>Co-Designer Needs Statement</h2>
										</header>

										<ul>
											<li>He needs to be able to hold the cup steadily</li>
											<li>He needs to be able to make sure that the content inside the cup does not spill</li>
											<li>He needs to be able to make sure that he is able to hold the cup without dropping it</li>
										</ul>
										<header>
											<h2>Product Requirements</h2>
										</header>

										<ul>
											<li>Waterproof</li>
											<li>Stable </li>
											<li>Easy to remove and clean</li>
											<li>Able to attach onto other cups easily</li>
											<li>Sturdy grip for stability</li>
											<li>Rotating handle to counteract shaking</li>
											<li>Light</li>
											<li>Around 9 centimeters tall</li>
										</ul>

											<h2>Initial Brainstorming Narrative</h2>
										</header>

										<p>I wanted to help L drink from cups without having to worry about spilling his drink due to hand tremors. L had not tried nor was he aware of any tools to help him, so I had to do some research on preexisting solutions. All the products available today failed to satisfy my co-designer's need statements. One solution had a rotating handle that helped counteract the shaking, but it was not able to be attached to any other cups. Other solutions presented a sturdy grip with a strap to fit around any size cup, but they did not have any aspect that helped with shaking. My first idea consisted of a rotating handle attached to the top of suction cups with a rotating part. Upon review, we realized that this design was faulty. One of the product requirements, however, states that the product should be easily removable. For the suction cups to safely stick onto a cup and ensure that they did not fall off, the suctions had to be quite strong, making it difficult for the user to pull off. I then decided to combine the best features of the various products I found on the Internet. The concept I decided to move forward with has stretch bands to fit any cup size. It also has a rotating handle added onto the end of the bands to counteract the shaking.</p>

											<h2>Initial Prototype</h2>
										</header>
										<header>
											<h3>Prototype Design Objectives:</h2>
										</header>

										<ul>
											<li> For my low-fidelity prototype, the main objective is to build a product that does not spill the liquid in the cup</li>
											<li> The prototype does not need to completely nullify the shaking, and the appearance is not a priority</li>
											<li> Once all of these objectives are made, I will know which steps I can take to improve my design</li>
										</ul>
										<header>
											<h3>Assumptions</h2>
										</header>
										<ul>
											<li>Co-designer does not need any special type of grip shape</li>
											<li>Product will be used in his home and work space</li>
										</ul>
										<header>
											<h3>Bill Of Materials</h2>
										</header>
										<ul>
											<li>modeling clay</li>
											<li>food wrap</li>
											<li>3 rubber bands</li>
											<li>cardboard</li>
											<li>twine</li>
										</ul>

										<header>
											<h3>Testing Plan</h2>
										</header>

										<p>For testing, I plan on seeing how my product will hold up against shaking. My co-designerâ€™s need statements focused on making sure that the liquid inside the cup does not spill, so I will see how much liquid is spilled when shaking is present. </p>

											<h3>Testing Results</h2>
										</header>

										<p><span class="image fit"><img src="prototype2 - Matthew.jpg" alt="a picture of low-fidelity prototype of the customizable cup handle with a customizable cover" /></span></p>
										<p> After testing, I was able to see that my design was not steady. The handle was shaking constantly and was not rigid enough to provide support. Additionally, some liquid was pouring out from my adjustable cup cover. The cup handle, however, was the right size for my co-designer.</p>
										<p> Conclusion: From my testing, I learned that I need to make the handle more rigid so that my co-designer can hold the cup steadily. I also need to make sure that it is comfortable to hold. Thus, I need to design a handle that is stable, but also comfortable to use. </p>
