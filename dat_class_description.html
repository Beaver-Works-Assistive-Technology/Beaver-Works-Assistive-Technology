									<p>This four-week summer program is a full-time product design and engineering course where high school students work with a member of their community to co-design and build a piece of assistive technology. The course includes synchronous online lectures, hands-on design exercises, small group technical mentorship, and project management activities culminating with students documenting and developing a custom AT solution.</p>

									<p>This course was offered in person in 2019 and is being offered virtually in 2021.</p>

										<h2>What is Assistive Technology?</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										Assistive technology (AT) is a device or a program that helps someone function in their daily life. More specifically, people with disabilities use assistive technology to overcome social, technological, or physical barriers in a range of settings. For example, someone might use:
										<ul>
											<li>a motorized wheelchair to get around in public</li>
											<li>screen reader software to hear on-screen content read out loud at the office</li>
											<li>an automatic page turner while studying at school</li>
										</ul>

										Assistive technology usually refers to technology in the context of disability, but can refer more broadly to things that help with impairments beyond what are traditionally considered "disability."

										<h2>What is "co-design" and why do we use it?</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										When we design solutions for people, end users can have widely varying levels of input during the design process. In this course, we emphasize the use of <i>co-design</i>, in which the end user of the product plays an <i>active role</i> in the process, from requirements development, to testing, feedback, and refinement. The term <i>co-designer</i> not only emphasizes their active participation, but also acknowledges their own domain expertise on how they carry out their own lives. This knowledge is especially important in the context of disability, because different disabilities manifest in different ways, and people have very individual adaptations that they may be used to.
									</p>

									<p>
										In other contexts, the terms <i>users</i>, <i>clients</i>, or <i>customers</i> might be used. Depending on the situation, clients and customers might be entirely appropriate, but they tend to be more passive (or transactional) than the relationship we are interested in for this class. We will also sometimes refer to co-designers as users when speaking of their relationship to the product in question.
									</p>

									<p>
										Co-design isn't always practical or possible though, especially when building general products for use by lots of people, or because of the time involved by the user, but the skills learned in the co-design process are very transferable to general product design and engineering.

										<h2>Summer 2021 Virtual Session</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										Normally, the Beaver Works Summer Institute (BWSI) would have been held in person at Lincoln Laboratory. However, due to complications created by the new era of the COVID, the course was moved online for the summer of 2021, with Zoom being the main platform for classroom meetings. A normal day for the students ran from 10 AM to 6 PM EST, with 2 lunch breaks to accommodate for students in different time zones.
										In addition to planned exercises and lectures, the students were also exposed to guest speakers working in assistive technology. Moreover, the virtual nature of the course brought a host of other alterations and unique challenges to the course. For instance, the main forms of communication were moved to Discord, with each student being provided a private channel to contact the staff,
										and the platform to chat with their peers. The number of co-designers the students were able to work with also changed, with students having to find and work with their co-designers rather than being in groups and working with a couple of designated co-designer. This change meant that this summer's course had a total of 19 co-designers, with 19 individual student projects.
									</p>
									<p>
                    The volume of unique projects also meant challenges in providing the students with materials in the limited timeline of the program. At the start of the program, the students were sent a box of materials that they could use to create lo-fi prototypes of their products. After their lo-fi prototypes, students were also given the chance to submit the materials they needed for their 2nd and 3rd prototypes to the staff to be ordered from Amazon.
										However, due to the sheer variety of projects and differences in student circumstances, the students couldnâ€™t receive all their materials at the same time. Therefore, at times, due to time constraints, the students were also encouraged to shop for materials locally. So, an important part of this summer's course was making sure that the staff was careful in gauging each student's progress in the course.
										Moreover, general deadlines and requirements were still in place throughout the course to guide the students' projects. Overall, despite the difficulties presented during the course, it was still successful in providing the students with an adequate background in product design.
