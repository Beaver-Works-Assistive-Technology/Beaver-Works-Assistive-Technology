											<h1>A Helping Hand</h1>
										</header>
										<header>
											<h2>Co-Designer</h2>
										</header>
										<p>My codesigner is Ty, a middle school student from California. He loves playing sports, including football and basketball. In addition to sports, Ty has a passion for video games such as NBA 2k, a basketball video game on gaming consoles. As you can see, Ty is a normal kid with plenty of interests, but one thing that does make Ty unique is that he does not have a right hand. </p>

										<header>
											<h2>Co-Designer Needs Statement</h2>
										</header>
										<ul>
											<li>The product needs to be able to allow Ty to flexibly hold and grab things with his right arm.</li>
											<li>The product needs to be durable enough for long-term use.</li>
											<li>The product needs to comfortably fit on Ty.</li>
										</ul>
										
										<header>
											<h2>Product Requirements</h2>
										</header>

										<ul>
											<li>Be able to grab things efficiently</li>
											<li>Durable for long-term use</li>
											<li>Easy to use</li>
											<li>Comfortable to wear</li>
											<li>Easy to take off and put on</li>
											<li>Secure when put on</li>
										</ul>

											<h2>Initial Brainstorming Narrative</h2>
										</header>

										<p>We came up with an idea of developing a prosthetic hand that would allow Ty to grasp and hold items. There already exists an open source 3D printable prosthetic hand that is very effective, however closing the fingers requires a wrist-actuated mechanism. Ty has adequate wrist mobility, but it is still to be determined if the area of his partial palm is large enough to properly use the wrist-actuated mechanism to close the hand. Therefore, we have designed a Lo-Fi prototype with the purpose of examining and measuring the mobility of Ty's wrist, the dexterity of his partial palm, and the overall fit of the device on his forearm. We've also brainstormed a few alternative mechanisms (such as EMGs or electronic joysticks) that could substitute the wrist-actuated mechanism, but these require considerable adjustments to the original open-source design. We plan to build the prosthetic hand by printing the needed components via a 3D printer and purchasing a package (which includes screws, threading, elastic bands, etc.) that the open source provider sells.</p>

											<h2>Initial Prototype</h2>
										</header>

										<header>
											<h3>Overall Design Objective</h3>
										</header>
										<p>The problem I am trying to solve is how to create a closing mechanism for a 3D printed wrist-actuated prosthetic hand.</p>
										<p>I know when I have solved this when my co-designer is able to comfortably and efficiently use a closing mechanism.</p>
										<p>This is under the assumption that the user already has some wrist mobility and somewhat of a partial palm.</p>

											<h2>Second Prototype</h2>
										</header>
										<header>
											<h3>Prototype Design Objective</h3>
										</header>
										<p>With this prototype I aim to determine if the default wrist-actuated mechanism in closing the hand is suitable for my codesigner. The wrist-actuated mechanism requires a partial palm of an appropriate size and dexterity to be effectively used. The objective of this prototype is to assess the size of my codesigner’s partial palm and wrist mobility and dexterity. If my user has the appropriate wrist mobility and partial palm size to fit inside the prototype and wear it comfortably, then I will know that the default mechanism is sufficient. If not, then I must augment the mechanism to make it sufficient.</p>

										<p>3D-printed palm is printed at 130% scale: 2.6 inches in width, 1.15 inches in height, 3 inches in length</p>
										<p>Cardboard arm guard: 8 inches (at highest point) and 6 inches (at lowest point) in height, 6.375 inches in width</p>

										<p><span class="image fit"><img src="arm_measurements.PNG" alt="arm measurements" /></span></p>

										<header>
											<h3>Test Plan</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Take measurements of</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Forearm Length</li>
											<li>Partial Palm Length</li>
											<li>Partial Palm Width</li>
											<li>Partial Palm Height</li>
											<li>Wrist Circumference</li>
											<li>Wrist Width</li>
											<li>Forearm Circumference</li>
										</ul>	
										
										<p>Test the mobility and comfortability of the Lo-Fi prototype.</p>

										<ul>
											<li>Ask codesigner to move wrist and partial palm up and down while wearing the 3D printed palm</li>
											<ul>
												<li>High angle to medium angle</li>
												<ul>
													<li>Repeat 7-10 times each for total of 3 sets </li>
												</ul>
												<li>Medium angle to low angle</li>
												<ul>
													<li>Repeat 7-10 times each for total of 3 sets </li>
												</ul>
												<li>High angle to low angle</li>
												<ul>
													<li>Repeat 7-10 times each for total of 3 sets </li>
												</ul>
												<li>Ask co-designer which degree of movement was most comfortable</li>
											</ul>
										</ul>
										<p><span class="image fit"><img src="high_medium_low_angles.PNG" alt="high, medium, and low angles of wrist positioning" /></span></p>
										<p>High, medium, and low angle</p>

										<ul>
											<li>Ask codesigner to rotate wrist in clockwise and counterclockwise direction and move partial palm again</li>
											<ul>
												<li>Repeat 3 times</li>
											</ul>
										</ul>

										<p>Use modelling clay to increase the size of the codesigner's partial palm for the 3D printed palm (if needed).</p>

										<p>Ask the codesigner to wear a lofi prototype and give feedback.</p>

										<ul>
											<li>Breathibality: Does wearing the prototype make the arm too hot? Will sweat and moisture be an issue?</li>
											<li>Durability: Is the PLA plastic of the palm a suitable material? How often do you plan to use this outdoors? </li>
										</ul>

										<header>
											<h3>Test Results</h3>
										</header>
										<p>The result of our tests included the following</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Measurements (<span>&#177;</span> 0.375 in, <span>&#177;</span> 1 cm)</li>
											<ul>
												<li>Forearm Length: 9 in, 22 cm</li>
												<li>Partial Palm Length: 1.25 in, 4 cm</li>
												<li>Partial Palm Width: 2.2 in, 5.875 cm</li>
												<li>Partial Palm Height: ~ 1.25 in, 3.175 cm</li>
												<li>Wrist Circumference: 6.75 in, 17 cm</li>
												<li>Wrist Width: 2.12 in, 5.33 cm</li>
												<li>Forearm Circumference: 6.75 in, 17cm</li>
											</ul>
											<li>Ty has adequate wrist mobility and a large enough partial palm to proficiently use the default closing mechanism, thus we will plan to print the entire 3D hand without adjustment to the closing mechanism.</li>
											<ul>
												<li>The cardboard armguard was a bit faulty and unnecessary for our test, so for our test run we removed the cardboard armguard and only used the 3D printed palm</li>
											</ul>
											<li>The 3D printed palm (printed at 130% scale), was a bit too small for Ty. Thus in an effort to increase space for the partial palm to fit, we soaked the hand in warm water and manipulated the opening of the palm to have more space. This caused the palm to crack a bit on its right side (with the opening of the palm facing towards you).</li>
											<ul>
												<li>The end of Ty’s partial palm has a larger width than the wrist area, thus the hand should accommodate for that.</li>
												<li>Since the palm was too small, when Ty would bend his wrist it dug into his skin and caused some discomfort.</li>
											</ul>
											<li>We discussed a bit about possible breathability issues that may occur.</li>
											<ul>
												<li>Sweating and poor breathability may increase discomfort</li>
											</ul>
											<li>Ty felt that it was most comfortable for his wrist to go from a high angle to a medium flat angle. Thus, we decided that the wrist-actuated closing mechanism will mimic this same movement.</li>
											<li>Ty had comfort and good mobility when rotating his wrist in the clockwise and counterclockwise direction. </li>																		
										</ul>

										<header>
											<h3>Prototype Conclusions</h3>
										</header>
										<p>The default wrist-actuated closing mechanism proved to be a success. Ty has the adequate wrist mobility and partial palm size to be able to use it effectively. Since printing the 3D model scaled at 130% is too small, the next plan is to print it at 155%. We also discussed possibly making material alterations to increase comfort and breathability of the design. I hope to print and bring an entire assembled 3D printed hand made of PLA to Ty for the next iteration. </p>
