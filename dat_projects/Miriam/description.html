											<h1>The Garden Cart</h1>

											<h2>Co-Designer</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Meg is a Retired Science teacher. Meg likes reading, cooking, traveling, and gardening. Meg likes to spend many hours gardening; however, as she has knee issues and gardening requires bending her knees down often to pick things up or pot plants, she has to take breaks during gardening. Meg tends to misplace her gardening tools and her coffee cup while gardening, as she does not have one centralized location where she keeps her tools.</p>

										<header>
											<h2>Co-Designer Needs Statement</h2>
										</header>

										<ul>
											<li>Meg needs to minimize bending as she plants in her garden.</li>
											<li>Meg needs a portable high surface to place plants as she harvests and weeds her garden.</li>
											<li>Meg needs a place to put her coffee cup as she gardens.</li>
											<li>Meg needs a centralized location where she keeps all her tools.</li>
										</ul>
										<header>
											<h2>Product Requirements</h2>
										</header>

										<ul>
											<li>Stable </li>
											<li>Water resistant</li>
											<li>Rot and mold resistant</li>
											<li>Four sturdy wheels with breaks (must be able to roll on stone, dirt, and pebbles)</li>
											<li>Can hold 20.5kg +</li>
											<li>Easy to clean and removable “tray”</li>
											<li>Storage/holder for: clippers, trowel, plant tags, 3x5" inventory cards, sharpie, pencil, wire for plants, plant knife, weeder, space for 1-2 seasonal items, and coffee or water</li>
											<li>76.2 cm tall to the bottom of the “tray”</li>
											<li>86.4 - 91.4 cm overall height</li>
											<li>Single 38.1 cm long handle to move around</li>
											<li>38.1 x 50.8 cm inside the frame</li>
											<li>Max 43.18 x 50.8 cm outside the frame</li>
											<li>Umbrella holder or space to clip mini umbrella</li>
										</ul>

											<h2>Initial Brainstorming Narrative</h2>
										</header>

										<p>I wanted to help Meg be able to garden for extended periods with more ease. I assessed the solutions she had tried before, such as setting up multiple potting benches around her garden; I found that this method took up too much space and was not effective in helping her keep track of her tools, but this method was effective in that it is a high surface she can work on. I utilized the idea of an elevated surface to develop the concept of a portable high surface. I researched gardening carts and other mobile carts to understand existing products. I found that current products were not portable, the wrong height for Meg, or not for outdoor use. One of my original ideas did not have to do with gardening. My idea was to design a cart to bring groceries from Meg’s car to her kitchen easily, so she would have to bend her knees less. As Meg's primary issue had to do with gardening I took the idea of a grocery cart and altered it to a gardening cart. The main aspects of the gardening cart were that it would be a sturdy, metal, portable high surface that is a centralized location to keep gardening tools, with the feature of height adjustability. I discarded the idea of height adjustability, as it would have caused the design to be flimsy. I decided the design would be constructed out of wood rather than metal due to the risk of sharp edges. The concept I am moving forward with is a wooden, high, portable, stable surface to replant plants on, hold weeds and harvested plants, and is a centralized place to keep gardening tools and her coffee cup. This design addresses Meg’s need statements and her product requirements while being cost-effective and sturdy. </p>

											<h2>Initial Prototype</h2>
										</header>

										<p>I aim to help my co-designer, Meg, have more ease as she gardens. Meg experiences knee pain as she gardens from bending over. When Meg can garden with less knee pain, she will work in her garden for more extended periods of time. </p>
										<p>With the second prototype, I focused on the cart's dimensions, identifying which height of the cart works best for my co-designer, and I focused on testing the strength of the bus tub. I did not test the product's width or with materials that would be in the high-fidelity prototype. </p>
										<p>After understanding the dimensions, the cart should have, I can move on to my third prototype. The product will be used outdoors and on many different surfaces. I assume my co-designer will wash the bus tub once a month, so the bus tub has to be easy to clean, so the tub I chose is simple to wash and dishwasher safe. I assume that my co-designer will only use the design outside and not have to carry it upstairs. </p>

										<ul>
											<li>Walker - Free (from co-designer)</li>
											<li>Plant - Free (from co-designer’s garden)</li>
											<li>Cultivator - Free (from co-designer)</li>
											<li>Two Five Pound Weights - Free</li>
											<li> Rubbermaid Bus Tub 15 x 20″ - $15.84</li>
										</ul>

											<h3>Testing Plan</h3>
										</header>
										<p>I inserted the 15 x 20″ Rubbermaid Bus Tub in the top of the walker and made sure the bottom of the tub was 30″ off the ground. My co-designer placed a potted plant in the Bus Tub and tested if the prototype caused her shoulder strain by using a cultivator to dig up her plant. I then put two five pound weights in the tub to check the stability of the tub. My co-designer tested digging with the cultivator sitting down as well. After my co-designer tested the prototype I asked her for feedback.</p>

											<h3>Test Resutls</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Co-Designer’s Rating 1- 10 (Ten being the best)</p>
										<p>15 x 20″ Rubbermaid Bus Tub</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Sturdiness - 10</li>
											<li>Depth - 10</li>
											<li>Cleanability - 10 </li>
										</ul>
										<p>Dimensions Tested</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Height at 30″ - 10</li>
											<li>“I like that it is standard, so it can be replaced,” Meg said about the bus tub. My co-designer liked the height at 30″ for both standing and sitting. The metric I used to measure whether sitting worked was if my co-designer experienced any shoulder strain while she was planting. Meg did not experience shoulder strain while sitting or standing. </li>
										</ul>
										<header>
											<h3>Prototype Conclusions</h3>
										</header>
										<p>I am ready to move on to my next iteration as I know the measurements that work best for my co-designer. The product works best at the height of 30″. What needs to be tweaked is the weight of the cart: there needs to be more weight at the bottom of the cart, so the cart is not too heavy on the top of the cart. This issue will be adjusted as there will be wheels at the bottom of the next iteration.</p>
										<p>Note: The technical drawing and the tested prototype are different as I used the materials I had readily available to test the design before moving on to using materials that will be in my high-fidelity prototype. </p>
