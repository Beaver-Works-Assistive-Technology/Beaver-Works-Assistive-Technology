											<h1>A Step Up</h1>
										</header>
										<header>
											<h2>Co-Designer</h2>
										</header>
										<p>My co-designer is Jocelyn, who is one of my friend's aunts. She is a retired doctor and enjoys gardening in her free time.</p>

										<p>Jocelyn also has Parkinson's disease, which means she often has a hard time balancing, turning quickly, and lifting heavier objects. As a result, she often has trouble reaching higher places of storage around her house, which she wishes to use safely and effectively. Existing stools have provided little assistance in terms of balance; the stool she currently has is 9 inches tall and help her reach shelves. However, the stool has a small surface area, which gives little room for movement or stabilization. Additionally, while using the stool she has, Jocelyn has to hold onto tables or other sturdy structures to add extra support.</p>
										<header>
											<h2>Co-Designer Needs Statement</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Jocelyn needs to be able to:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>steadily reach higher shelves in her house </li>
											<li>maintain her balance while reaching for higher places</li>
											<li>lift the product herself</li>
											<li>store the product in compact spaces</li>
										</ul>

										<header>
											<h2>Product Requirements</h2>
										</header>

										<p>The product must: </p>
										<ul>
											<li>help the co-designer reach higher shelves, giving her 7-9 in. of height</li>
											<li>have ample space for standing and moving on with a length & width of at least 20 in x 15 in</li>
											<li>must not tip over/be able to withstand at least 150 lbs</li>
											<li>be light enough to move — definitely no more than 20 lbs</li>
											<li>be collapsable + easy to store</li>
										</ul>

										<header>
											<h2>Initial Brainstorming Narrative</h2>
										</header>

										<p>The idea of my project is to create sturdy railings around a 7-9 inch high, relatively large stool. First, I assessed the product requirements with my co-designer and thought about some tools we use to access higher shelves—we use ladders, smaller step ladders, and stools. Since the product had to have ample space for movement and had to be relatively light to move, I decided to build my concept around something similar to a stool, as my extended searches yielded very little. </p>
										<p>I originally wanted to create the railings on all four sides of the stool with retractable metal rods, which was inspired by the stick on a roller backpack (as shown in Fig. 1). I thought that if the metal legs of the railing was retractable, it would allow the railing feature of the design to be much more compact. However, due to limitations caused by the pandemic, I realized that learning to weld and finding the welding tools would be pretty difficult. </p>
										<p>Then I moved on to change the design to  wood as I've had a little bit of experience in the past with woodworking. However, after changing the design to wood, the issue then became making the project compact. With remote learning, brainstorming became a much more individual task—this meant that there was much more room for error. I decided to continue consulting my co-designer and actually visited her in person to take some measurements. After creating some rough cardboard prototypes, taking some measurements, and ping-ponging some ideas with my co-designer, I was inspired by a small, foldable table in her house (which I coincidentally had as well) and I was able to incorporate the folding elements into my design (Fig. 4).</p>
										<p>After learning that the current stool my co-designer had wasn't ideal in terms of surface area, I started looking into larger stools on Amazon and discussed the options with my co-designer. Ultimately, we found a stool designed for RVs that was 24" x 15.5" and had an extended height of 7.5"; it had 4.6/5 stars from nearly 1000 reviews and was also great for the outdoors, which would be great if the project extended to help my co-designer garden particularly tall tomatoes. </p>
										<p>Moving forward, I have to determine some more measurements to ensure the sturdiness of the design, determine/order the right materials, and consult the instructors for feedback on the design (especially with how many sides to put "railings" on). I'm really excited to start building and create a project that could help my co-designer!</p>

										<header>
											<h2>Initial Prototype</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Overall Design Objective: </p>
										<p>- The objective of Stools+Rails is to create a design that could help the co-designer, Jocelyn, be able to reach higher shelves easier and safer while remaining relatively light to transport. </p>
										<p>- The objective will be met when the co-designer is able to reach higher shelves (or tall tomatoes) with ease and expresses satisfaction in the product's safety and weight.</p>
										<p>Prototype Design Objectives</p>
										<p>- I want to work on creating a prototype that solves the problem of safety and has correct measurements; due to shipping and pandemic constraints, creating a compact prototype will be an objective to focus on in the future. I will be able to move on to the next prototype once the co-designer is satisfied with the current prototype.</p>
										<p>User Assumptions:</p>
										<p>- Stools+Rails would be used indoors (for reaching higher shelves) and outdoors (for gardening purposes).</p>
										<p>- Stools+Rails would be put against at least one sturdy surface (ex. kitchen counters, planter box, etc.)</p>

											<h3>Testing Plan</h3>
										</header>
										<p>I plan to test this prototype with my co-designer both inside and outside her house to see if Jocelyn could use the stool to safely garden and rearrange items on her higher shelves.</p>
										<p>Subjective qualitative questions:</p>
										<p>Rate from 1-10 with 1 being the worst and 10 being the best how...</p>

										<ul>
											<li>safe you felt before and after the existence of Stools+Rails</li>
											<li>well the height of the prototype fits you </li>
											<li>easy Stools+Rails is to use </li>
											<li>heavy the the prototype is</li>
											<li>easy it is to transport the prototype</li>
											<li>aesthetics</li>
										</ul>

										<p>Subjective quantitative questions:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>What is your favorite part about the design?</li>
											<li>What is your least favorite part about the design? </li>
											<li>Are there any features or suggestions you have at this point?</li>
										</ul>
										<header>
											<h3>Test Results</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Subjective qualitative questions:</p>
										<p>I found out that my co-designer rated getting onto stools without the railing a 2/10; however, with Stools+Rails, she felt 10/10 safe reaching for higher shelves and plants. She felt that the height of the railings were pretty accurate and helpful to her, so she rated the height a 10/10.
											In regards to the ease of use, my co-designer felt that the concept of using the stools and the rails together was pretty easy to understand and use, so she rated it a 9/10. However, for the weight of the prototype, she rated it a 7/10 and gave the ease of transport a 5/10 due to the bulk of the prototype. For aesthetics of the railings, she rated it an 8/10.</p>
										<p>Subjective quantitative questions:</p>
										<p>My co-designer mentioned that her favorite part of the design was that the railings were safe, efficient, and steady, which were the most important factors for her. My co-designer also mentioned that the bulk of the railings was her least favorite part about the design, but that the bulk was a negligible part of the design.</p>
										<p>Observations:</p>
										<p>I noticed that my co-designer's tomatoes were pretty large, which may make picking tomatoes an issue, especially if she does not have a bag. As a result, adding a small detachable basket onto the rails may help with storing her gardening tools as well as the fruits she may pick while standing on the stool.</p>
										<header>
											<h3>Test Conclusions</h3>
										</header>
										<p>I found that my co-designer, Jocelyn, was pretty excited about this prototype iteration. Due to time and pandemic constraints, I was unable to use welding and order some items because of the shipping time. As a result, I focused more on making a safe and effective stool and railing set so that my co-designer could begin using higher shelves and pick her tomatoes independently.</p>
										<p>In the future iterations, I'd like to make something that could make transporting the PVC pipes iteration easier or focus on making the prototype more compact. For a smaller iteration, I would also look into finding a detachable basket that could help making the gardening aspect of the stool much more convenient. </p>
