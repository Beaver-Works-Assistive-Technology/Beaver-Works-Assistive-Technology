											<h1>The Stair-Climbing Walker</h1>
										</header>
										<header>
											<h2>Co-Designer</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Name: Ambiga</p>
										<p>Living Situation: Lives in a 2 floor house alongside a family friend</p>
										<p>Daily Routine: Wakes up, makes a cup of coffee, cooks breakfast, looks over any work/chores she has to complete, talks to friends/family, cooks lunch, goes on a walk, completes rest of whatever work/chores she has left, cooks dinner, sleeps (in between whenever she has time she watches TV or plays games on her tablet)</p>
										<p>Hobbies: Art, Cooking, Walking</p>
										<p>Occupation: None</p>	
										<p>Relation to Me: Grandmother</p>	
										<p>AT-Related Need: Knee pain that flares up whenever she puts too much pressure on her knee</p>	
										<p>Solutions they have already tried: Massaging knee with ointment, sleeve to compress knee</p>										

										<header>
											<h2>Co-Designer Needs Statement</h2>
										</header>

										<p>Ambiga needs to be able to...</p>
										<ul>
											<li>walk up and down the stairs while producing less stress on her knee</li>
											<li>efficiently and safely walk up the stairs</li>
											<li>easily get on and off the couch</li>
											<li>move around the house and areas outside the house efficiently and quickly</li>
										</ul>
										<header>
											<h2>Product Requirements</h2>
										</header>

										<ul>
											<li>Not easily corrodible</li>
											<li>Little to no nooks within the product</li>
											<li>Must work on all types of surfaces including flat, staircase, grass, wood, stone, etc.</li>
											<li>Handles to grab onto and move around easier</li>
											<li>Light weight (less than 15 lbs)</li>
											<li>Should be able to support 55+ lbs</li>
										</ul>

										<header>
											<h2>Initial Brainstorming Narrative</h2>
										</header>

										<p>Had to come up with something to help keep pressure off of her knee or to help keep her knee sturdy within her daily activities.</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Knee Brace</li>
											<li>Walking Cane</li>
											<li>Walker</li>
											<li>Sturdy Handle to help her get on and off of couch</li>
											<li>Wheelchair</li>
										</ul>
										<p>Out of all of these products I thought the brace, cane, or walker would be the best because it would be available to her in her daily life and not focused on one specific activity in particular.</p>
										<p>I took these three ideas and talked it out with her and she liked the walker the best because she said it would have the most postive impact and that it seemed more realistic.</p>
										<header>
											<h2>Initial Prototype</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Overall Design Objective: The product should help relieve pressure off of my grandma's knee whe she is walking up/down the stairs or when walking across flat ground.</p>
										<p>Prototype Design Objectives: With this specific protoype I hope to be able to see if the measurements are correct and if the adjustable legs work like I want them too. I don't want to see if they work structurally but rather if they work based on pure height and keeping the walker flat when going up and down the stairs.</p>
										<p>Assumptions: I am assuming that the staircases she will walk up/down will not exceed the height of the stairs I have at my house. I am assuming this because the stairs at my house are very steep in general and when compared to her usual route of walking they are much larger than any staircase she will witness.</p>
										<p>Bill of Materials: I am only using pencils, cardoard, hotglue, and duct tape that I already have at home, so there is no purchasing cost.</p>

											<h3>Testing Plan</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Test Plan: I plan on just using my mom to test this intial prototype because in terms of height, armspan, etc. my mom and grandma are very similar. The cardboard prototype is not structurally sound so having my grandma walking up the stairs with it would put unnecessary pressure on her knee and I don't want to cause her any pain. So I instead am planning on having my mom holding the walker as the goes up and down the stairs and visually see if the walker is still flat and at a comfortable level to hold.</p>

										<p><span class="image fit"><img src="flat - Rishi.jpg" alt="cardboard prototype walker being used on flat ground" /></span></p>

										<header>
											<h3>Test Results</h3>
										</header>
										<p>The measurements came back positive and the walker maintained a flat and comfortable height level as it went up and down the stairs. One thing, however, was that there was a significant amount of strain on my tester's arm and legs because teh cardbopard did not have any strong structure for her to rest her weight on. This would be the problem we would tackle in the next protoype: to make it stronger.</p>
										
										<header>
											<h3>Prototype Conclusions</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Overall, this protype was a success in terms of what it was supposed to measure and conclude. The next steps would be to design a stronger and more structurally sound version of this prototype using the same measurements.</p>
