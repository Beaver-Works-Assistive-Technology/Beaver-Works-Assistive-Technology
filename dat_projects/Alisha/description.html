											<h1>Blackout!</h1>
										</header>

											<h2>Co-Designer</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Divya is a rising senior in high school who lives at home with her parents and her little sister. She uses she/him pronouns (which can be used interchangeably!) and plays varsity field hockey at school. Divya enjoys all sorts of mediums of art, such as clay, paint, and wood. Recently, she's been taking a dive into graffiti and street art and her signature or graffiti 'tag' is a bloody eye! He has been my friend since kindergarten and loves to binge watch Criminal Minds and go for walks with his husky, Moo. Divya gets sudden migraines that give her blurry vision and makes her extremely sensitive to light. Previous solutions such as eye masks didn't work for him as it pressed against his eyes and made the migraine auras worse. Her room also only has blinds, which don't block out light well enough for it not to affect her migraines.</p>

											<h2>Initial Brainstorming Narrative</h2>
										</header>

										<p>When Divya told me about his migraines, I immediately started thinking of some sort of blackout glasses to get rid of the light that made his migraines worse. I realized, however, that traditional glasses wouldn't work because Divya would be sleeping in them, and the frames might make her uncomfortable, so I knew I would have to add a more comfortable way for the glasses to wrap around the face.</p>
										<p>I initially looked into specific blackout lenses for Divya. I found that the lenses were viable, but the problem with them would be the light that comes in from the top and bottom, as they weren't close to the face. I talked with Divya and I was given the idea to look into products like ski goggles instead of plain glasses. The pros of ski goggles included the fact that they pressed against the face with foam around it so it wouldn't touch the eyes but still provide coverage. The parts I had to focus on were the vents in the ski goggles where light could potentially come in, and I also had to think about how I would improve on the straps to make it more adjustable and comfortable for sleep. </p>

											<h2>Initial Prototype</h2>
										</header>
										
										<p><span class="image fit"><img src="blackout diagram.JPG" alt="sketch of blackout device design" /></span></p>

										<header>
											<h2>Second Prototype</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Objective: to make a pair of glasses that block out light and are also comfortable enough for her to sleep in.</p>										
										<p>My objective with this initial prototype was mainly to test the comfort of the solution I was looking at, as Divya would be sleeping with this product, so comfort was key. I wanted to try the effect of elastic against her face and if it would be too tight, and also tried mimicking the blackout lenses I was originally planning on using, to see if that would be a good fit. </p>
										<p>Assumptions: I assumed that Divya would be alright with wearing something on her face for a long period of time, considering the fact that she had tried eye masks during migraines. I also assumed that he would not toss and turn a lot, as he had mentioned he was a sound sleeper. As for the blackout lenses, I assumed that if there was weight put on it while sleeping, it would not crack or be pushed uncomfortably into Divya's eye.</p>
										<p>As my initial prototype was quite simple, I did not have to use any materials that I didn't already have. I used cardboard and measured the shape and size of the blackout lenses I was looking into, and I used a large band of elastic attached to the makeshift lenses to mimic an actual strap. </p>
										
										<header>
											<h3>Testing Plan</h3>
										</header>
										<p>I decided to test the comfort of the lenses and how effective it would be at blocking out light. Both Divya and I tested the initial prototype, specifically trying things like lying down and standing up to see how the light bled in, and how the elastic felt against our heads. We tried it in the light with the blinds up and with the blinds down to get a sense of how it would work in different times of the day. </p>

											<h3>Test Results</h3>
										</header>
										<p>As was expected with the rudimentary prototype, it wasn't too comfortable and it let in light from the top and the bottom of the makeshift lenses. Divya found that while the elastic was comfortable to lie down in, it had a chance to be either too loose and let in light that would worsen her migraines, or be too tight and push the lenses against her eyes, making her migraine auras worse. The makeshift lenses let in light from many angles and also pressed against her eyes. </p>

										<header>
											<h3>Prototype Conclusions</h3>
										</header>
										<p>The conclusion I drew from Divya's discomfort with the elastic was that an adjustable strap, such as one with Velcro, would be a much better fit for him. After talking to others about Divya's problems with the makeshift lenses, I found that something like ski goggles would be a great solution for both of these problems. Ski goggles have foam on the inside of the goggles for increased comfort, meaning that it would hold the lenses away from the eyes. It also meant that the chances of letting in light to the eyes would be greatly decreased, though there were vents in many of the ski goggle brands I looked at. The downside to ski goggles versus blackout lenses would be that I would have to work on covering the lenses in order to not let in any light, but as the pros outweighed the cons, and covering the lenses with something like paint would be easy enough, I decided to go ahead to my next prototype with my new ideas. </p>
