											<h2>Co-Designer</h2>
										</header>
										<ul>
											<p>My co-designers are my grandmother Harriet, who has Alzheimer's disease, and my grandfather, Herb, who is her main caretaker. Their time mostly consists of daily chores like cooking, cleaning, and eating. They both like to read the paper at the kitchen table as they eat, visit family, and make time to take an afternoon nap together every day. Because of Harriet’s Alzheimer’s, she can no longer do most of these tasks by herself, so Herb spends most of his time caring for her. With age, they have both been developing mobility issues, which makes two floor living a bit more difficult. They are not at the point yet where they need full time help, but they do have cleaners and an aid that helps with harder tasks like showering Harriet. </p>
										</ul>

											<h2>Co-Designer Needs Statement</h2>
										</header>
										
										<p>After my initial discussion with Herb, we decided that whatever product I made needed to support one of his daily chores (cooking, cleaning, pet tortoise care, etc.).</p>
										
										<header>
											<h2>Product Requirements</h2>
										</header>

										<p>With the help of my father and my aunt, we expanded the product requirements. It would need to: make one daily chore easier or faster; be easy to use with limited or slower mobility; be intuitive to use (i.e. a single switch, not a complex system); be customized and adapted to fit their current house; be safe to use and interact with (especially with fall risk). </p>

										<header>
											<h2>Initial Brainstorming Narrative</h2>
										</header>

										<p>My aunt, father, and I decided that safety on the stairs was an area that would be good to focus on. Harriet and Herb have two staircases in their house, one from the basement to the first floor and another from the first floor to the second floor. The staircases are very narrow and steep, both of which increase Herb's risk of falling. In order to mitigate this risk, I decided that I should focus on a product that transports a laundry basket up and down the stairs so that Herb does not have to carry anything when navigating staircases and can focus solely on his walking. Herb and I decided that the basement staircase would be better to install a system into because it is hidden from the rest of the house and will have a longer term effect since they may transition to single floor living in the future.</p>

										<p>My first idea when tackling the idea of a laundry transport, was to create a pulley system along the wall or the hand railing that would allow Herb to simply hook a laundry bag onto a carabiner and then either push a button to activate a motor or use a hand crank to get the bag up the stairs. However, this proved to be too complicated when it came to space constraints and safety concerns regarding the tangle potential of having loose cable hanging on the wall. I had to then pivot quickly and spent a few hours in the stairwell taking measurements and talking through ideas with my father and Herb. We finally settled on a ramp and a hand winch. The ramp will be hooked flush against the wall when not in use and the winch would be attached to the wall at the top of the stairs. When it is time for Herb to bring his laundry up the stairs, he will unravel the cable on the winch, unclip the ramp, place the basket on the ramp and attatch the cable to the front, and then walk up the stairs alongside the ramp before cranking the winch to pull the basket up. Once the basket is at the top of the stairs, he would unhook the cable and either clip the ramp back up or leave it down for next time. This same process would also work for letting the basket down the stairs, he would just turn the winch in the other direction. </p>
