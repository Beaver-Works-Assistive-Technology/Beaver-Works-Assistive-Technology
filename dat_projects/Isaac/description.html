											<h2>Co-Designer</h2>
										</header>
										<p>C is my co-designer and is a relative of mine. She lives in a small apartment in Hong Kong with her grandchildren. She goes on daily grocery errands for lunch and dinner and watches cooking shows in her free time. Some of her hobbies also include shopping with friends and learning how to cook. C has arthritis which creates hand pains when she is constantly gripping, a big problem for her when she's out during her daily errands and constantly gripping onto groceries. Over the shoulder hand bags are awkward for her to put groceries in and using backpacks in the past has given her back pains over time (as she is a senior)</p>

										<header>
											<h2>Co-Designer Needs Statement</h2>
										</header>
										<ul>
											<li>Product must prevent gripping/hand pains</li>
											<li>Product must be portable and lightweight for traveling</li>
											<li>Product must support C in comfortably doing errands without outside assistance</li>
										</ul>

											<h2>Product Requirements</h2>
										</header>

										<ul>
											<li>Waterproof</li>
											<li>Portable, small preferably</li>
											<li>Can carry grocery bags (no exact weight yet)</li>
											<li>Light weight</li>
											<li>Easy to use, nothing too challenging</li>
											<li>Assist in errands, not requiring outside help</li>
											<li>Limit hand usage when outside to prevent pain</li>
											<li>Take account of the busy environment</li>
											<li>Product should not be flashy/stand out easily</li>
										</ul>

											<h2>Initial Brainstorming Narrative</h2>
										</header>

										<p>I clarified the problem by pin pointing something my co-designer does on a daily basis and found out how her issues with arthritis have affected her daily shopping errands.  My initial designs were actually different forms of bags designs (over the shoulder and backpacks) that were specifically suited for groceries. I ended up discarding these ideas after my second talk with my co-designer which she expressed her previous, frustrating experiences with these products. This design was something I put together over a few days after taking consideration of my co-designers needs and product specifications. I chose this design as it fulfills both needs and specifications and understandable/simple to use after presenting my idea to my co-designer.</p>
