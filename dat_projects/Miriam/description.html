											<h2>Co-Designer</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Meg is a Retired Science teacher. Meg likes reading, cooking, traveling, and gardening. Meg likes to spend many hours gardening; however, as she has knee issues and gardening requires bending her knees down often to pick things up or pot plants, she has to take breaks during gardening. Meg tends to misplace her gardening tools and her coffee cup while gardening, as she does not have one centralized location where she keeps her tools.</p>

										<header>
											<h2>Co-Designer Needs Statement</h2>
										</header>

										<ul>
											<li>Meg needs to minimize bending as she plants in her garden.</li>
											<li>Meg needs a portable high surface to place plants as she harvests and weeds her garden.</li>
											<li>Meg needs a place to put her coffee cup as she gardens.</li>
											<li>Meg needs a centralized location where she keeps all her tools.</li>
										</ul>
										<header>
											<h2>Product Requirements</h2>
										</header>

										<ul>
											<li>Stable </li>
											<li>Water resistant</li>
											<li>Rot and mold resistant</li> 
											<li>Four sturdy wheels with breaks (must be able to roll on stone, dirt, and pebbles)</li>
											<li>Can hold 20.5kg +</li>
											<li>Easy to clean and removable “tray”</li>
											<li>Storage/holder for: clippers, trowel, plant tags, 3x5" inventory cards, sharpie, pencil, wire for plants, plant knife, weeder, space for 1-2 seasonal items, and coffee or water</li>
											<li>76.2 cm tall to the bottom of the “tray”</li>
											<li>86.4 - 91.4 cm overall height</li>
											<li>Single 38.1 cm long handle to move around</li>
											<li>38.1 x 50.8 cm inside the frame</li>
											<li>Max 43.18 x 50.8 cm outside the frame</li>
											<li>Umbrella holder or space to clip mini umbrella</li>
										</ul>

											<h2>Initial Brainstorming Narrative</h2>
										</header>

										<p>I wanted to help Meg be able to garden for extended periods with more ease. I assessed the solutions she had tried before, such as setting up multiple potting benches around her garden; I found that this method took up too much space and was not effective in helping her keep track of her tools, but this method was effective in that it is a high surface she can work on. I utilized the idea of an elevated surface to develop the concept of a portable high surface. I researched gardening carts and other mobile carts to understand existing products. I found that current products were not portable, the wrong height for Meg, or not for outdoor use. One of my original ideas did not have to do with gardening. My idea was to design a cart to bring groceries from Meg’s car to her kitchen easily, so she would have to bend her knees less. As Meg's primary issue had to do with gardening I took the idea of a grocery cart and altered it to a gardening cart. The main aspects of the gardening cart were that it would be a sturdy, metal, portable high surface that is a centralized location to keep gardening tools, with the feature of height adjustability. I discarded the idea of height adjustability, as it would have caused the design to be flimsy. I decided the design would be constructed out of wood rather than metal due to the risk of sharp edges. The concept I am moving forward with is a wooden, high, portable, stable surface to replant plants on, hold weeds and harvested plants, and is a centralized place to keep gardening tools and her coffee cup. This design addresses Meg’s need statements and her product requirements while being cost-effective and sturdy. </p>
