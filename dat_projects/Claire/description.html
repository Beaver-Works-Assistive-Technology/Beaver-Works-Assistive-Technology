											<h1>Standing Trackpad</h1>
										</header>
										<header>
											<h2>Co-Designer</h2>
										</header>
										<p>My co-designer is my dad (Dennis). He is 49 years old and works as a project manager, spending the workday on the computer. In his free time, he enjoys reading, cooking, watching movies, and running. </p>

										<p>Over time, he developed carpal tunnel syndrome from extensive computer mouse use with his right hand. This causes wrist pain and a numb feeling in his hand. To take the pressure off of his wrist, he switched to a vertical mouse. However, he still felt strain from using a scroll wheel and pushing down on the mouse to click. Trackpads and trackballs also didn’t improve his condition because they required him to keep his wrist in a tense position. Currently, he is looking for a solution that allows him to keep his arm and wrist as relaxed as possible without interrupting his workday. </p>
										<header>
											<h2>Co-Designer Needs Statement</h2>
										</header>
										<ul>
											<li>The product must keep his hand in a loose position rather than gripping an object.</li>
											<li>The product must allow him to use mouse functions (scrolling + clicking) without straining wrist.</li>
											<li>The product must prevent his wrist from being pressed on a surface.</li>
											<li>The product must be comfortable to use while standing up.</li>
										</ul>

										<header>
											<h2>Product Requirements</h2>
										</header>
										<ul>
											<li>Can scroll/click while keeping hand close to relaxed position</li>
											<li>Tap to click trackpad</li>
											<li>Adjustable position</li>
											<li>Allows hand to be in natural position when standing</li>
											<li>Stable</li>
											<li>26.5 inches high for standing position (from floor to bottom of trackpad)</li>
											<li>Lightweight</li>
										</ul>

											<h2>Initial Brainstorming Narrative</h2>
										</header>

										<p>My co-designer spends the majority of his day using a computer and mouse at work and felt frustrated with the frequent pain he felt in his wrist. This pain often interfered with his workday, so I wanted to make an assistive device that would allow my co-designer to work with his hands, wrist, and arm in a less strained position throughout the day.</p>
										<p>Initially, I thought of adding different grip options on his mouse to prevent his hand from remaining in the same grip position. However, gripping a mouse and using a scroll wheel both eventually put stress on his wrist. During the interview process, I also learned that he prefers to stand up when working; his most comfortable standing position was having his arms straight and hands relaxed at his sides. Based on this information, I decided to put a trackpad in a vertical position at the height his hand reached when relaxing his arms at his side. The trackpad would be placed in a 3d printed case, then secured by fabric straps that clip onto my co-designer’s pants. Therefore, he would potentially be able to keep his hands and arms as close to his relaxed position as possible.</p>

											<h2>Initial Prototype</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Initially, I thought of adding different grip options on his mouse to prevent his hand from remaining in the same grip position throughout the day. This idea involved either being able to change the angle of the mouse or having multiple grip positions available. While my co-designer liked the vertical position of the mouse, he expressed that gripping the mouse and having to use a scroll wheel would still eventually put stress on his wrist. </p>
										<p>Instead of building off of his current mouse, I thought about using a trackpad to avoid having him grip any object at all. I switched the idea of a mouse that could change angles to a trackpad that could be used at multiple angles.</p>
										<p>My co-designer liked the idea of a trackpad as an alternative to a mouse. In the past, he had tried a trackpad, but it required him to keep his wrist and fingers in a raised, tense position. At this point, we were leaning towards a product that was in a vertical position and did not require his hand to hold it.</p>
										<p>To brainstorm more concepts, I looked back at my interview notes. During the interview, a discussion about his work setup had come up. I learned that he prefers to stand up while he works at the computer; his most comfortable standing position was having his arms straight and hands relaxed at his sides.
											Based on this information, I decided to modify the vertical trackpad idea and attempt to position the trackpad where his fingers would reach when his hands were just relaxed at his sides.</p>
										<p>The initial idea included a vertical trackpad that would be strapped around my co-designer’s leg, so that he could use mouse controls while standing up and keeping his hands and arms as close to his relaxed position as possible. After bringing this idea to my co-designer, we agreed that having a strap around his leg for several hours at a time would make it harder for the trackpad to stay in place, and more importantly, feel uncomfortable for him to move freely.</p>
										<p>Eventually, we decided on having the trackpad attached to straps that would clip to his pants, essentially hanging the trackpad down to where his hands would be positioned.</p>

										<p>I am trying to lessen the wrist pain that my dad feels when using a mouse. I will know that I have solved it when my co-designer is able to use the product without feeling wrist pain.</p>
										<p>With this prototype, I am trying to figure out the most optimal position of the trackpad that would allow my co-designer to use mouse controls with his hands and arms relaxed at his sides when standing up. Once we find an approximate position, I will find different ways to hold the trackpad up.</p>

											<h3>Testing Plan</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Iteration design objective:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Find a comfortable position for trackpad to be at</li>
											<li>Find out whether fabric straps can be used to hold the trackpad up</li>
										</ul>
										<header>
											<h3>Testing Procedure</h3>
										</header>
										<p>I clipped the fabric straps to my co-designer’s pants, asked him to mimic scrolling and clicking motions on the cardboard, and observed whether the trackpad would move from its initial position.</p>
										<header>
											<h3>Test Results</h3>
										</header>
											<p>Observations</p>
											<ul>
												<li>The trackpad slides out of position when fingers scroll in different directions</li>
											</ul>
											<p>Feedback From Co-designer</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Cardboard representation of trackpad was too light and kept shifting positions</li>
												<li>Wants the straps to be adjustable </li>
												<li>Concerned about actual trackpad being uncomfortable to rest on side of leg</li>
											</ul>
											<header>
												<h3>Prototype Conclusions</h3>
											</header>
											<ul>
												<li>A trackpad holder would need more friction to not slide against clothing</li>
												<li>Fabric straps wouldn’t be able to attach to the actual trackpad </li>
												<li>Scrolling directions on vertical trackpad might not be intuitive</li>
												<li>Trackpad might cause inconvenience when walking around, taking breaks, etc.</li>
											</ul>

											<h2>Second Prototype</h2>
										</header>

										<p>Now that I had purchased an actual trackpad, I realized that I wouldn’t be able to put fabric straps directly on the trackpad. I decided to make a case for the trackpad, and attach the straps to the case. I built an initial prototype of the case out of cardboard and placed the actual trackpad inside to see if it was convenient to use. I also wanted to find ways to prevent the trackpad from sliding out of place when in use. </p>

										<p>Prototype design objective</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Find out if the trackpad case feels comfortable when resting on leg</li>
											<li>See if trackpad disrupts his current workflow</li>
											<li>See if adding rubber to the back of the trackpad prevents it from slipping</li>
										</ul>
										<header>
											<h3>Testing Procedure</h3>
										</header>
										<ul>
											<li>Two trials were tested: one without rubber bands taped on the back of the trackpad case, and one with rubber bands taped on the back of the case</li>
											<li>To test if using the trackpad in the case interfered with his usual workday, we tested multiple workflows such as checking his email, scrolling through webpages, and clicking on different links.</li>
										</ul>
										<header>
											<h3>Test Results</h3>
										</header>
											<ul>
												<li>The trackpad case stayed in place when the rubber bands were taped to the back of the case.</li>
												<li>His wrist was sometimes bent at a slight angle</li>
												<li>Concerned about actual trackpad being uncomfortable to rest on side of leg</li>
											</ul>
											<p>Feedback From Co-designer</p>
											<ul>
												<li>The right and left scrolling directions on the trackpad should be swapped to feel more intuitive.</li>
												<li>The prototype straps are too short. </li>
												<li>Trackpad doesn’t restrict his arm/hand movement.</li>
												<li>He didn’t realize that he would sometimes bend his wrist slightly; this was due to muscle memory from using a trackpad on a desk in the past.</li>
											</ul>

											<header>
												<h3>Prototype Conclusions</h3>
											</header>
											<ul>
												<li>Trackpad scrolling directions need to be customized.</li>
												<li>Rubber tape should be added to the back of the final prototype case to mimic the effect of the rubber bands.</li>
												<li>Fabric straps should be adjustable to account for different postures on different days.</li>
												<li>It would take some time for my co-designer to get used to not having to bend his wrist when clicking and scrolling</li>
											</ul>
