										<h1>Final Prototype</h1>
									</header>
									
									<p>The final prototype is a more refined version of your product that has gone through some iterations of design, test, and re-deisgn. It might just be what your co-designer needed, or you may have a ways to go (so it may only be "final" for the purposes of this class). We'd like to know how you made it, and how others could make it as well! Also, <b>please include pictures and videos whenever possible</b>.</p>

									<p> This page is similar to to initial prototype page, but there are some key diffreences. Please read it carefully!</p>

									<header class="main">
										<h2>About that thing you made...</h2>
									</header>

									<ul>
										<li><b>Overall Design Objective</b> - What is the problem you are trying to solve? How will you know if you have solved it?</li>
										<li><b>Assumptions</b> - What are you assuming about the user? About the environment the product will be used in? Anything else related to product use?</li>
										<li><b>Bill of Materials</b> - What are you using to build your prototype? Include quantities, order links, and cost breakdown of any purchased materials.</li>
										<li><b>"Technical Drawing"</b> - Can be a CAD model, a wireframe, a hand-drawn sketch, a fabric pattern, a wiring diagram, and more! Include multiple views and detailed specifications and/or constraints (sizes, shapes, resistances, weights, etc) when possible. If you're using something like an obj or stl file (anything to be read by specific software), please also include an image of the item(s).</li>
										<li><b>Build Instructions</b> - How would another maker build this? Include any specific pain points you noticed, or any particularly sensitive parts of the design (things that were strongly affected by slight changes). See <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Full-Body-Oven-Mitts/">this Instructables article for Nico's Full Body Oven Mitt</a> as an example.</li>
									</ul>

									<header class="main">
										<h2>Final exams!</h2>
									</header>

									<ul>
										<li><b>Test Plan</b> - How do you plan to test your prototype? What can you test by yourself, with your co-designer, or with others? Are there specific times or places that you need to pay attention to for testing?</li>
										<li><b>Testing Pictures</b> - If your tester(s) are okay with it, document your tests with pictures! Always be sure to ask for permission first, though.</li>
										<li><b>Results</b> - What happened? What did you learn? Detail any quantitative ("The plastic sleeve was 2 cm too long") and qualitative ("My codesigner had to strain her neck to reach the spot where her head was supposed to go") observations, as well as any direct user feedback.</li>
									</ul>

									<header class="main">
										<h2>Letters to a future you</h2>
									</header>

									These don't have to be literal letters, but we'd like you to think about a few things after going through your final prototype.

									<br>
									<br>

									<ul>
										<li><b>Future Improvements</b> - What did you learn from this iteration? What worked, and what needs to be tweaked or entirely redesigned? What would you do if you had more time and/or resources?</li>
										<li><b>Scalability</b> - We're doing individual co-design in this course, but can you tell us something about how <i>scalable</i> your design is? How specific is your solution to your codesigner and/or their environment? Are there other people it might help? How do you think you'd go about making 100, 1,000, or 10,000 copies of this? It's perfectly fine if the answer is that your product is completely unscalable and is super-specific to your co-designer. Tell us why, and congratulations on tackling a problem that would likely have otherwise been ignored!</li>
										<li><b>Design Process Reflection</b> - What would you do differently if you had to go through this process again? This part is focused on the process, rather than anything about your product that you learned along the way.</li>
