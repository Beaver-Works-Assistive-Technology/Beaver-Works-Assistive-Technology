											<h2>Co-Designer</h2>
										</header>
										<p>My co-designer is my grandpa, whose pseudonym will be L. He is 86 years old and currently lives in Seoul, Korea.  He enjoys watching TV, hanging out with friends, and playing card games. One of his favorite games to play is poker. L started to notice hand tremors about 15 years ago. He would spill his drinks whenever the hand tremors occurred. L noted that when he tries to not spill his drinks, he tends to spill more than when he does not pay attention to his hand tremors. </p>

											<h2>Co-Designer Needs Statement</h2>

										<ul>
											<li>He needs to be able to hold the cup steadily</li>
											<li>He needs to be able to make sure that the content inside the cup does not spill</li>
											<li>He needs to be able to make sure that he is able to hold the cup without dropping it</li>
										</ul>

											<h2>Product Requirements</h2>

											<h2>Initial Brainstorming Narrative</h2>
										</header>

										<p>I wanted to help L drink from cups without having to worry about spilling his drink due to hand tremors. L had not tried nor was he aware of any tools to help him, so I had to do some research on preexisting solutions. All the products available today failed to satisfy my co-designer's need statements. One solution had a rotating handle that helped counteract the shaking, but it was not able to be attached to any other cups. Other solutions presented a sturdy grip with a strap to fit around any size cup, but they did not have any aspect that helped with shaking. My first idea consisted of a rotating handle attached to the top of suction cups with a rotating part. Upon review, we realized that this design was faulty. One of the product requirements, however, states that the product should be easily removable. For the suction cups to safely stick onto a cup and ensure that they did not fall off, the suctions had to be quite strong, making it difficult for the user to pull off. I then decided to combine the best features of the various products I found on the Internet. The concept I decided to move forward with has stretch bands to fit any cup size. It also has a rotating handle added onto the end of the bands to counteract the shaking.</p>
